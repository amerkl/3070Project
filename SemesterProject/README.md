#Research Question:
Do LSU events influence Crime Rates in the Baton Rouge area?

##The Data
The data used for the analysis comes from Open Data BR (https://data.brla.gov/Public-Safety/Baton-Rouge-Crime-Incidents/fabb-cnnu) Crime Safety API and the 2018 LSU Football Schedule. These two sources were joined together to analyze how the different factors of LSU Football games, such as Attendance, Game Outcome, Opponent, and Points Scored, can affect crime rates overall as well as specific crime type rates, to see where safety might be lacking.

#Conclusion
LSU events do not have a significant impact on the amount of crimes committed a day, but rather the types of crimes that are committed. The details of the analysis are covered in the HTML and PDF analysis reports.
